# ðŸ›’ Shopping List (DOM Scripting Practice)

This is a simple web app built as part of the **MDN DOM Scripting tutorial**. It allows users to add and remove items from a shopping list in real time using JavaScript and basic DOM manipulation.

### What It Does

- Dynamically adds list items based on user input
- Creates and attaches delete buttons for each item
- Updates the page without reloading (using pure JS)

### What I Did

- Practiced selecting and modifying DOM elements
- Used JavaScript to respond to user events (clicks and form submissions)
- Dynamically created HTML elements and attached them to the page
- Learned how to structure simple interactive behavior without libraries or frameworks

This project helped reinforce foundational skills in front-end scripting and DOM interaction.
